                                I am currently a Student Assistant at UC Davis Advancement Services,
                                where I provide general clerical support regarding gifts and donations to UC Davis and the related data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Last year, I was a Research Assistant at the Asian American Center on Disparities Research at UC Davis.
                                I presented my research at the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Conference.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am also the Legislative Director for the ASUCD (Associated Students, UC Davis) Executive Office,
                                where I wrote the resolution that made ASUCD officially adopt the working definition of anti-Semitism
                                used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have intermediate in Python, R, C++, JavaScript, SPSS, and Oracle Database (SQL).
                                I have some knowledge in MATLAB, HTML, CSS, and data warehouses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my free time, I write movies, compose music, and play piano.
