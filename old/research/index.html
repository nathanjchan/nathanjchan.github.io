                        <p>
                            During the 2017-18 school year, I was a Research Assistant at the Asian American Center on Disparities Research
                            at UC Davis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The study I worked on was about differences in face concern, or one's own self-image, between Asian Americans and
                            White Americans. As a study confederate, I gave a survey to over 30 participants that gathered data on
                            psychological measures related to emotion and reactions to negative events.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also gave a test to participants,
                            where they had to come up with as many uses of a brick in three minutes, and gave them fake results, positive or
                            negative. I conducted a video-recorded interview to see how they reacted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The data set had a sample size of 425 UC Davis students and contained all the survey data.
                            I performed data analysis on it, using ANOVAs and multiple regressions in SPSS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I designed and wrote a poster titled <i>
                                Ethnic and Gender Differences in Emotion Regulation Strategies: The Mediating
                                Role of Face Concern
                            </i>.
                            The purpose was to investigate how concern for one's own self-image affects reactions to
                            negative events, and how it differs between Asian and White Americans. We found that two emotion regulation strategies
                            (reactions to negative events), self-blame and positive refocusing, were mediated by face concern. More information can
                            be found in the poster and abstract.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I presented the poster at the 2018 Undergraduate Research Conference at UC Davis. The abstract was also published in the
                            abstract book. I earned a certificate for outstanding academic achievement in the presentation of scholarly research.
